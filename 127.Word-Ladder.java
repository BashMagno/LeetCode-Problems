/*
A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a dictionary wordList is a sequence of words beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk such that:

Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need to be in wordList.
sk == endWord
Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return the number of words in the shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, or 0 if no such sequence exists.

 

Example 1:

Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
Output: 5
Explanation: One shortest transformation sequence is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> cog", which is 5 words long.
Example 2:

Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
Output: 0
Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.
 

Constraints:

1 <= beginWord.length <= 10
endWord.length == beginWord.length
1 <= wordList.length <= 5000
wordList[i].length == beginWord.length
beginWord, endWord, and wordList[i] consist of lowercase English letters.
beginWord != endWord
All the words in wordList are unique.

/*
The ladderLength method takes beginWord, endWord, and wordList as input.
It first converts the wordList into a HashSet for faster lookup.
It performs a BFS using a queue. In each iteration, it generates all possible transformations of the current word and checks if they are in the word set.
If a valid transformation is found, it is added to the queue for further exploration, and it is removed from the word set to avoid revisiting.
The process continues until the endWord is found or the queue is empty.
If the endWord is found, it returns the level, which represents the length of the transformation sequence. Otherwise, it returns 0.
